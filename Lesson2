High availablity is core to the cloud 
You dont own the hardware 
you add more servers with a click
if hardware fails, replace it instantly
use clustures to ensure high availability

Reliability
Resilience - The ability of a system to recover from failures to continue to function

Deploy in multiple locations - 
Global scale computing
protects against reginal failure 

No single point of failure - 
resources in multiple locations
if one computer goes down, others pick up the load 

scalability 
automatically ajust resources to meet demand 

Horizontal scaling - addining addditinal VM's/containers (Scaling out)
Vertical scaling - Incresing power of existing vm's (scaling up)

Predictability
Predictable performance and cost 
Performance - Consistent  experib=nce for customers regardless of traffic
autoscaling, load balancing and high availability provide a consistent experience

Costs
No unexpected surprises
Tranch and forescast resource usage(costs) in real time 
We can use analytical tools to check cloud costs 

Security 
Full control of security of your cloud environment

Governence
Standardized encironments, Audit for compliance

Manageability
Management of cloud - Autoscaling, Monitoring, Template-based deployments

Management in the cloud - Portal, CLI, API's

High availability means systems are always available - even automatically 
Reliabilty describes how azure can tolerate failures

The Economy of Cloud Computing 
capital and operational expenditure - Capex is money spent by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assests, such as land, buildings and equipment

Operational expenditure 
An ongoing cost for running a product, business or system on a day to day basis including annual costs 

*Cloud Service models*
- Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
infrastructure= actual servers 
Scaling is fast 
No ownership of Hardware 

- Platform as a service(PaaS)
Paas supports web applications life cycle 
Avoid software licenece 
For example - Middleware, Tools 

- Software as a service 
Providing a managed service 
pay a fees 
No maintainence 
For examples -applications  

- Serverless(Extreme PaaS)
you dont have to manage any servers 
Azure functions is the best known  serverless service
